XLATE:
------
- move stopping of queues (resources) into compnnets themsolfg
	NOTE! Might not be a good idea since stopping a queue will impact other components
- in TranslationJob, change map so that map is sorted by segment number (we'll then print out segments in correct order)
	NOTE! Might nbot be a good idea since it's the translation task id which is the keye
- document how shutdown should be done + how it should be designed
- ensure we can restart a component that have been stopped
- go through logging in details to see what to log at what level
- make sure we handle all errors
- need tow tmos for engines - one when engines are starting, another when engines are running
- add callback when a segment has been trasnlated so we can measure progress
- need tmo for segments in repositpry - should be eneough with a single tmo and a list of tmos pointing to tasks (we don't need multiple deadline timers running)
- add cmd line parameters for debug, #engines, tmos, etc.
- add more JobHandlers (email, saving to file, paths, program to truse for translation etc.)
- check that there are no bugs in repository with mismatch with adding tasks in wrong place
- go through in detail how we start a translator (execvp etc.)



OTHER COMPONENTS:
-----------------
- conversion/retro-conversion
- segmenter



INFRASTRUCTURE:
---------------
- implement socket_queue
- add building in parallel - takes to long time to build now
- add method for geting queue pointer form queue_listere()/queue_sender()


TRANSLATOR:
-----------
- install moses and use it directly


DESIGN:
-------
- the job repository should probably send segments to scheduler so segments could be retried if timed out (should we handle timeout - failure?)
- architecture should be re-visited 
- how should engines be attached to system
- how should resource allocation be handled
