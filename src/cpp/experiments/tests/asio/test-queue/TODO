=== improvements ===

- so that we don't have to have timers to stop enq/deq:
	- implement async_timed_deq()
	- implement async_timed_enq()
	- implement async_timed_enq_wait()

- add error code as return for enq()/deq() so that we can separate various failures from filtering or from disable of the queue
	this will impact the queue_listener/queue_sender

- pass queue by reference instead of as shared_ptr<> to queue_listener/queue_sender
	(we'll hold queue by reference in queue_listener/queue_sender)
	(this is easy but will take an hour or two)

- possibly rename the 'queue' concept to 'channel'

- add filter to all queues (accept/reject - default is to accept all messages)


=== new queues ===
- implement 'socket_queue' (can be used to talk across machines)

- implement 'fd_queue' (can be use to talk to moses when item type is 'string')
