=== improvements ===

 - NOTE! Write an fdenq_queue class - which allows enquing and serialising out to an fd

 - change disrectory structure so we have boost/asio instead of boost/*

 - change std::size_t ms --> chrono time

- is it possible to support any 'pointer type' for queue

- add filter to all queues (accept/reject - default is to accept all messages)


=== new queues ===
- implement 'socket_queue' (can be used to talk across machines)

- implement 'fd_queue' (can be use to talk to moses when item type is 'string')
