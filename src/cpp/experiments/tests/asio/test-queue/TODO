- implement 'socket_queue' (can be used to talk across machines)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> WORKING ON <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


=== improvements ===

 - copy new fd queues to library ones they have been tested

 - change disrectory structure so we have boost/asio instead of boost-extensions/*

 - change std::size_t ms --> chrono time

- time for waiting for a message is not done correctly in socket queues. We time to get a connection 
  then start timing again when connection is established

- is it possible to support any 'pointer type' for queue

- add filter to all queues (accept/reject - default is to accept all messages)


=== new queues ===

- implement 'shareddier_queue' for queues on shared dierctories
