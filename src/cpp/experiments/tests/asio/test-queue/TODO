=== improvements ===

- change disrectory structure so we have boost/asio instead of boost-extensions/*

- change std::size_t ms --> chrono time

- time for waiting for a message is not done correctly in socket queues. We time to get a connection 
  then start timing again when connection is established

- is it possible to support any 'pointer type' for queue

- add filter to all queues (accept/reject - default is to accept all messages)


=== new queues ===

- implement 'sockservdeq_queue; - deq queue handling multiple client connections
- implement 'shareddir_queue' for queues on shared dierctories
